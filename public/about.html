<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, <br />
  <br />
  My name is Joshua Fran. I was born and raised in the beautiful island of
  Odiongan, Romblon, Philippines. I moved to Canada when I was 15 years old,
  accompanied by mother's co-worker.

  During my free time, I love to spend working and improving my skills on my
  hobbies. Two of my main hobbies are playing guitar and programming.
  Previously, I enjoy gaming so much where I would spend more than 10 hours a
  day. It felt like an addicition but as I grew. I learned how to take control
  of that addiciton and took action.
</p>

<p>
  I am open on learning many things and would love to explore more about the
  world. As a young adult, I carried my childish heart and curiosity that
  developed my bubbly and bright personality. I enjoy meeting and talking to
  people making new friends. I hope to be successful and be financial free one
  day so I could travel and broaded my knowledge in all areas of learning.
